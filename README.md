### DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge

# Project Overview

- The DJS01: Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge is a project that simulates the challenges faced in a spacecraft navigation system, highlighting the importance of precision and accuracy in calculations. The project involves debugging, refactoring, and enhancing JavaScript functions designed to determine the trajectory of a spacecraft. The initial functions are flawed, resulting in incorrect calculations due to unit mismatches and parameter misalignments.

- I had to identify and understand the errors in the provided functions, specifically unit mismatches and parameter misalignments. I also had to refactor and correct the functions to handle parameters more effectively, incorporating object destructuring for clarity and implementing necessary unit conversions. I used JavaScript in order to fulfil my tasks.

# Elements Included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

- Using a try-catch block and declaring a variable inside of it.
- Making sure that my calculations give out the correct answer.

## Challenges Faced

- Understanding the code - I had to go through it a couple of times in order to fully understand it and make sure that I complete the task at hand
- Time management - found it challenging to manage my time effectively to complete the project within the given timeframe.

## Areas of Improvement

- Error identification - I could develop a more systematic approach to identifying errors in code, such as using debugging tools and techniques.
- Testing - I would like to explore different testing frameworks

# Overall Learning Experience

- This project provided a practical example of how a simple unit mismatch can lead to bad consequences, emphasizing the importance of precision and accuracy in calculations. I'm glad I got a hands-on experience in identifying and understanding errors in code, specifically unit mismatches and parameter misalignments, and modifying the code to handle parameters more effectively and implement necessary unit conversions. Overall this project provided a valuable learning experience.
